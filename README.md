In this project I have created 4 different html pages\
One main page named index.html\
3 recipe pages with content pulled from allrecipes website along with images\
I have used anchor, img, ul, ol, H1-2 tags along with some attributs to build this basic website with multiple pages\
Also learned to commit at different parts of project progression\
